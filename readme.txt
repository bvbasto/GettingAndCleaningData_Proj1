Script:
All the code is on the run_analysis.R.
There is a text file with the output of step 4


Some notes about the script:
	- The zip file is present and was read directly.
	- The column names are reset on the first step so they can be used to filter columns with mean and std
	- As described in the features_info file, mean() is the variable with averages, meanFreq is not used
	- "BodyBody" changed to "Body"
	- t and f prefix became fully described on the final dataset
	- IÂ´ve used some capital letters in the final column names, to make them more readable
	- Also generated a dataset text file in step 4
